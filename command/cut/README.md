# cut

## Availability

Busybox includes `cut`, thus Alpine Linux does.

Alpine path: /usr/bin/cut


## Fields (by delimiters)

Delimit on space, print second word only:

	echo 'a b c' | cut -d ' ' -f 2

Add `--complement` to remove the second word (shows all others).

Remove second and third columns (`c` and `d`), print all others:

	echo 'a b c d e f g' | cut -d ' ' -f 1-2,5-

Can remove multiple column sections, like `-f -2,4-5,7-`.
Make sure there is **no space between the ranges** when typing the command.
