# node

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) allows scripts written in Javascript to
be used to access files and networking.
Released in 2009, it has a relatively young and rapidly evolving
community, but is well-supported by many organisations.

You can create and install packages for it with [npm](../npm/).
