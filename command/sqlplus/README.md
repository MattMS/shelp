# sqlplus

sqlplus is the command line interface to an Oracle database.

Apart from the "connect" examples, the rest are done when logged in.


## Connect to database as SYSDBA

	sqlplus / as sysdba


## Quit sqlplus

	exit


## View table details

	describe my_table_name

Prints "Name", "Null?" and "Type".
