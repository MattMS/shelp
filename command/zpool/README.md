## Virtual devices (vdevs)

A zpool is a collection of virtual devices.

Virtual devices cannot be nested.
A "mirror" or "raidz" device can only contain disks or files.

Hot spares can be added to come online if an active device fails.


### Device types

Using a full disk is preferred to using parts of a disk.

Using regular files as devices is strongly discouraged.
