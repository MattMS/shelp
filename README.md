# Shell help

I started this after becoming frustrated at various `man` and `--help`
pages that do not provide decent examples.

My thought is to record basic shell tasks I have had to search for in a
central repo that I (and hopefully others) will find useful.

	npm install -g shelp

You need to install it globally to get the `shelp` command.
